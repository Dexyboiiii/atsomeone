# atsomeone
A discord bot that mentions someone when @someone is found in a message. Probably been done before but I decided to spend 4 hours writing 34 lines of js instead :))

# To set up:
Create an auth.json file in the root, with
```json
{
    "token" : "your token here"
}
```
inside of it.

By default, bot.js has the bit that actually mentions people commented out because it's goddamn annoying - switch the commented line to the second one and it will mention people

# Things I'd like to do:
OKAY SO
- List of people who've specifically opted into being atsomeone'd
    - List of people who've opted out?
    - Could have a switch between mentioning those who've either been opted in or not opted out?
- Replicating the message the original author sent with the person atsomeone chose to mention included in it
- Would like to be able to mention one person from a specific role without it mentioning the whole role?
- Adding a help command
    - And a status of how to call it?
-
