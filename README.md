A discord bot that mentions someone when @someone is found in a message. Probably been done before but I decided to spend 4 hours writing 34 lines of js instead :))

Put the auth key in auth.json. By default, bot.js has the bit that actually mentions people commented out because it's goddamn annoying - switch the commented line to the second one and it will mention people
