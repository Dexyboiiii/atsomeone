A discord bot that mentions someone when @someone is found in a message. Probably been done before but I decided to spend 4 hours writing 34 lines of js instead :))

# To set up:
Create an auth.json file in the root, with
```json
{
    "token" : "your token here"
}
```
inside of it.

By default, bot.js has the bit that actually mentions people commented out because it's goddamn annoying - switch the commented line to the second one and it will mention people
